\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Motivation} - One trafficker reporting buying guns on the primary market in Virginia, which has relatively weak regulations, for \$150–200 and reselling them illegally in New York, which has relatively strict regulations, for \$500–600.
    \item \textbf{Research purpose} - This paper examines these issues, cross-state externalities and heterogeneous policies, in the context of gun policy in the United States.
    \item \textbf{Brief summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is found that guns flow from states with weak regulations to states with strict regulations. Hence, necessary condition for the existence of cross-state externalities is satisfied.
        \item A role for proximity is found, with more trade between nearby states, then it is noted that any externalities have a spatial component.
        \item Externalities are significant, with high possession rates by criminals being linked to weak regulations in nearby states.

 Straw purchase liability     &    Purchasing a gun on behalf of somebody else is a federal crime. Some regions have passed laws                                       allowing for local policing and and prosecution of straw purchasers. \\
 Falsifying purchaser 
 information liability        &    It is a felony under federal law to provide false information when purchasing a gun. Some states                                    allow for local prosecution of offenders. \\
 Background check 
 failure liability            &    A dealer who fails to conduct a background check has committed a misdemeanor under federal law.                                     Some states allow for prosecution and incarceration of these offenders. \\

 Gun show checks              &    Infrequent sellers of firearms are not required to be licensed under federal law. Several states                                    have attempted to close this “gun show loophole” with a variety of restrictions on casual gun                                       merchants. \\  
 Required purchaser permit    &    Several states require that all prospective gun purchasers acquire a permit, regardless of                                          whether the dealer has a federal firearms license. This procedure often includes a background                                       check. \\
 Local discretion to deny 
 carry permits                &    Concealed carry permits are available in every state except Illinois and Wisconsin. Some states                                     allow local law enforcement discretion to deny carry permits, even if an individual meets the                                       state and federal requirements. \\

Some states extend the restriction to those found guilty of other violent                                             misdemeanors. \\
 Required reporting of lost 
 or stolen guns               &    Some states require that lost or stolen guns are reported. \\  
 Local discretion over 
 gun regulations              &    Eight states currently allow municipalities, cities and countries authority to enact gun control                                    and regulation. \\
 Dealer inspections by state  &    ATF has inspection authority over licenced firearms dealers, but some states supplement these                                       inspections by allowing or requiring their own. \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Webster, Vernick, and Hepburn (2001), Cook and Braga (2001), Webster, Vernick, and Bulzacchelli (2009) - states with weak regulations tend to export more guns than states with stricter regulations.
    \item Kahane (2013) - examines a broader set of the determinants of trade flows such as role of police expenditures, the size of the economy, gangs, contiguity, and remoteness.
    \item DellaVigna and La Ferrara (2010), Dube, Dube, and García-Ponce (2011), and Chicoine (2011) - trafficking of weapons at the international level.
    \item Baughman et al. (2001), Kreft and Epling (2007), Lovenheim and Slemrod (2010), and Stehr (2010) - effects within the jurisdiction and spillover effects on neighboring jurisdictions associated with cross-border evasion of regulations.

\renewcommand{\sectiontitle}{Model of Gun Trafficking}
\section{\sectiontitle}
%\customToC{currentsection,hideothersubsections}{}

\begin{frame}{\sectiontitle}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The payoff to a trafficker from not purchasing a gun is normalized to equal $V_{td0} = \varepsilon_{td0}$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
V_{tds} = \beta + \alpha P_{d} - \gamma r_{s} + \delta X_{s} - \phi 1(\tau > 0) - \theta \tau_{ds} + \xi_{ds} + \nu_{s} + \varepsilon_{tds}    
\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The supply of firearms to destination $d$, which equals the number of traffickers times the probability of each trafficker supplying a gun to destination state d from any source state, including the domestic market
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
S(P_{d},r) = N Pr(g_{td}\neq 0) = \frac{N exp(\beta + \alpha P_{d} + \lambda e_{d}(r))}{1 + exp(\beta + \alpha P_{d} + \lambda e_{d}(r))}    
\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Where $r = ( r_{1} , r_{2} , ...)$ is a vector of regulations across all source states and the exposure index $e_{d}(r)$, which depends upon these regulations, is given by
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
    e_{d}(r)=ln\sum_{k}exp(-\gamma r_{k} + \delta X_{k} - \phi 1(\tau>0)-\theta\tau_{dk} + \xi_{dk} + \nu_k)
\end{equation*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\sectiontitle \emph{...continues}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The shift in supply in destination state $d$ in response to an increase in the number of regulations in source states $s$ is proportional to $\lambda$, responsiveness of supply to exposure.
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial S(P_{d},r)}{\partial r_{s}}=N Pr(g_{td} \neq 0)[1 - Pr(g_{td} \neq 0)]\lambda\frac{\partial e_{d}(r)}{\partial r_{s}}
\end{equation*}       
\begin{itemize}
    \item Any shift in supply is proportional to the marginal exposure, which equals
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial e_{d}(r)}{\partial r_{s}}=-\gamma Pr(g_{td}=s|g_{td}\neq 0) < 0
\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Given a price $P_{d}$, the probability that a given criminal in state $d$ purchases a gun is given by
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
    Pr(g_{cd}=1)=\frac{exp(\nu_{d}-\rho P_{d})}{1+exp(\nu_{d}-\rho P_{d})}
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\sectiontitle \emph{...continues}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item One can derive an expression for the externality associated with increasing the number of regulations in source
state s on destination state d as follows
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial o_{d}}{\partial r_{s}}=\frac{\frac{\partial e_{d}(r)}{\partial r_{s}}\lambda (\frac{\rho}{\rho+\alpha}Pr(g_{td}=0)}{(\frac{\alpha}{\rho+\alpha})Pr(g_{td}=0)+(\frac{\rho}{\rho+\alpha})Pr(g_{cd}=0)}
\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Externalities are stronger for nearby states than for distant states, and estimating this spatial parameter $\theta$ will be a key focus of our analysis of trafficking patterns.
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial^{2}e_{d}(r)}{\partial r_{s} \partial \tau_{ds}}=-\gamma\theta Pr(g_{td}=s|g_{td} \neq 0)[1-Pr(g_{td} = s|g_{td}\neq 0)]<0

    \begin{itemize}
        \item A theoretical and empirical analysis of cross-state externalities associated with state-level gun regulations is provided.
        \item Trafficking flows respond to gun regulations, with guns imported from states with weak regulations into states with strict regulations.
        \item Proximity matters, with trafficking flows more significant between two nearby states than between two distant states.
        \item Consistent with the existence of cross-state externalities, criminal possession rates tend to be higher in states exposed to weak regulations in other states.

\begin{frame}{\sectiontitle}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are many examples of cross-state externalities associated with policies set under decentralization.
        \item Public goods, such as highways, may be used by nonresidents, and, to the extent that benefits to these nonresidents are not internalized by policymakers, provision will be too low under decentralization.
        \item Goods associated with consumption externalities, such as cigarettes, fireworks, and alcohol, may be inefficiently taxed under decentralization to the extent that consumers can cross borders in search of lower-priced goods.
        \item Firms may be underregulated when pollution crosses borders and policymakers fail to internalize the costs to nonresidents.
